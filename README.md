## Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Installation
`yarn install` will install all necessary packages required to run the app

## Configuration

If the software is configurable, describe it in detail, either here or in other documentation to which you link.

## Usage
In the project directory, you can run:

yarn start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

yarn test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

yarn run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

yarn run eject 
Note: This project currently has been ejected but there are plans to revert the ejection once the .less is converted to a format that works with create-react-app
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## How to test the software

yarn test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## Getting help

Instruct users how to get help with this software; this might include links to an issue tracker, wiki, mailing list, etc.

currently focusing on; e.g., trying to get feedback on features, fixing certain bugs, building
important pieces, etc.
